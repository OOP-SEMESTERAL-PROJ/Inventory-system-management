# Inventory-system-management schoolsupplies

Inventory Management System for School Supplies is a digital tool developed by students of the College of Informatics and Computing Sciences, Batangas State University – ARASOF Nasugbu Campus. The system addresses the common problem of manually tracking school supplies, which often leads to shortages, unnecessary purchases, and disorganization.

Built using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, the system allows users to record, update, and monitor school supplies efficiently. Key features include tracking item names, types, and quantities, identifying low-stock items, generating shopping lists, and storing all records in a local database for easy access.

The system benefits school staff by simplifying inventory management and restocking, while students can request and receive supplies more effectively. Additionally, it provides developers with practical experience in programming and database management. Overall, this project demonstrates how digital tools can improve school operations, reduce waste, and ensure essential supplies are always available.
